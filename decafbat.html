    <h1>Decafbat</h1>
<p>Decafbat is an illustrator and philosopher[]. Her natural
    habitats are Furaffinity and Tumblr. She is part of a 
    writing and illustrating duo currently creating the 
    comic Larvie and Libro. </p>

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Decafbat is a mysterious creature of unknown origin. 
    As far as I know, she existed long before I was born and 
    will continue to live on long after I'm gone. 
</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Although she had been drawing since she was just a sprout,
    she began sharing her art on the internet when she was in 
her tween/early teen years. Most of her art is considered 
lost media</p>

<h2>Lost Media</h2>
<p>"In which Nicolas Cage battles Guy Fieri to the death." 
    was a macromedia flash animation created by Decafbat in the late 
    2010s and hosted on youtube.com. She created it using a method 
    that is commonly known as photobashing today. By combining 
    images and digital painting and animating them 
    by moving elements on keyframes. It was set to dramatic music
    and told the tale of Nicolas Cage's character from Con Air 
    getting into an epic battle to the death with famed TV 
    personality and restauranteur Guy Fieri.<br>
    In late 2025, it was removed from Youtube for violating 
    terms of service, and was sadly never archived. Thankfully, 
    the companion comic, "Con Air: Choose Your Own Adventure" is 
    still hosted on MSPFA.com and features many of the same 
    artistic stylings. Unfortunately, it seems that Poe's 
    epic battle may forever be lost to time.
