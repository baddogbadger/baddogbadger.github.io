    <h1>Decafbat</h1>
<p>Decafbat is an illustrator and <a href="philosophers.html">philosopher</a>. Her natural
    habitats are <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/decafbat/">Furaffinity</a> and <a href="https://tumblr.com/decafbat">Tumblr</a>. 
    She is part of the writing and illustrating duo behind the 
    comic <a href="https://larvieandlibro.neocities.org/">Larvie and Libro.</a> </p>

    
<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Decafbat is a mysterious creature of unknown origin. 
    As far as I know, she existed long before I was born and 
    will continue to live on long after I'm gone. 
</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Although she had been drawing since she was just a sprout,
    she began sharing her art on the internet when she was in 
her tween/early teen years. Most of her art is considered 
lost media</p>

<h2>Lost Media</h2>
<p>"In which Nicolas Cage battles Guy Fieri to the death." 
    was a satyrical macromedia flash animation created by Decafbat in the late 
    2010s and hosted on <a href="youtube.com" title="youtube.com">youtube.com</a>. 
     She created it by combining 
    images and digital painting and animating them 
    by moving elements on keyframes, a method 
    that is commonly known as photobashing. It was set to the song
    "How do I Live" by Micheal Guy Bowman
    and told the tale of Nicolas Cage's character from Con Air 
    getting into an epic battle to the death with famed TV 
    personality and restauranteur Guy Fieri.<br>
    In late 2025, it was removed from Youtube for violating 
    terms of service, and was sadly never archived. Thankfully, 
    the companion comic,  
    <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=25408&p=1" title="MSPFA.com">"Con Air: Choose Your Own Adventure"</a>
    is still hosted on <a href="mspfa.com">MSPFA.com</a> and features many of the same 
    artistic stylings. Unfortunately, it seems that Poe's 
    epic battle may forever be lost to time.
