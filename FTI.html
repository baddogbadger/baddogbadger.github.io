                            Many of us were told that the internet 
                            is forever, but it's been proven many times this isn't true. The 
                            internet, as a library, is a collaborative effort. If something is reposted, 
                            hosted by multiple servers, and maintained, it's safe to say
                            it will be around for a while. But things get left behind; servers 
                            shut down, websites get wiped, posts go unarchived. The things we lose 
                             often seem to be whatever doesn't pay into social media's engagement 
                             economy - stuff that doesn't get reposted, rehosted, or reshared.
                            
                             What do we stand to lose when 
                            what is deemed less popular is forgotten?</p>
