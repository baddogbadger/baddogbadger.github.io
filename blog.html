        <h2>WHAT GIVES, PORK BUN?</h2>
        <h3>05/18/24</h3>
           <p> so far i've been officially hosting my website on
            porkbun at <a href="https://fucktheinternet.wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fucktheinternet.wiki</a>
            but any time i make a change it takes forever to update and the layout is currently 
            busted for some reason. but i upload my files to neocities and it takes me 
            45 seconds to make a new account and dump my files (porkbun only allows you to
            upload one file at a time) and everything worked as intended, like, immediately.
            if neocities wasn't more expensive i'd 100% use it with my domain. if porkbun
            keeps acting up i might switch to something else. hit me up if you have advice.

        <h2>SORRY LOL</h2>
            <h3>05/18/24</h3>
               <p> okayy I wanted to get some articles done (using "articles" very loosely)
                to have something to fill the space and ended up writing about some Pedro
                the Lion music videos as well as their upcoming album and now my website
                looks like a David Bazan fansite. oops! it's just been on my mind lately
                and I don't have much else to post about. 
            </p>

            yeah man. my eyes fucking hurt i tell ya what. 
            it doesn't even look that great and good lord 
            is the html a mess. but you know what! it's better 
            than nothing. the spot i usually get stuck at when making 
            websites is usually right after it's all set up and
            now i've actually gotta fill this with stuff. i have ideas! 
            i want to upload some photos, mine and others that inspire
            me. i want this to be somewhere i can host physical media.
            maybe i'll write an about/manifesto section once the site's started
            to take shape. basically i'm a big fan of visual/physical media, but less
            of a fan of the way it is made available on the internet.
            i've been browsing the wayback machine, farming some nostalgia
            and inspiration for the website. and man, i really feel like we could 
            be doing a better job. it's hard to find a place to view art on the internet 
            without a subscription, and without being served more advertisement
            than art.<br><br>anyways. in the end, i'm gonna do what i want
            with the site. stick around if you'd like! always love to have ya over.
        </p>

               <p> HIII!!!! welcome to the blob! this is where i 
                word dump and rant about stuff. prepare yourself for inconsistent 
                tone, capitalization, and all that shit. i really just
                can't be bothered, having to do this all manually in HTML is 
                difficult enough. anyways. i hope you enjoy your visit!
