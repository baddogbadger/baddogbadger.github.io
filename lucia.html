<h2>Background</h2>
<p> 
    I was born in Missouri and lived there until moving to Wisconsin when I was 12. 
    I had the sort of upbringing that makes you a sort of interesting person but 
    ultimately alienates you from your peers. I know a lot of people have had a similar 
    experience, and we're all interesting and cool and fucked up in our unique ways. 
    Apart from a year or two in montessouri elementary school, I was homeschooled until 8th
    grade. For most of our childhood my siblings and I were technically "unschooled," which
    is one way to say I spent most of my early years running around in the woods instead 
    of learning math. That's not to say my childhood was devoid of learning. I read constantly, 
    and spent countless days at the library while my parents worked at their restaurant.
