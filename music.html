<p>I've been going back to my older songs to figure out how to play them
    and improve upon them, but this one is tripping me up. I recorded it
    last may (2024) while I was experimenting with different tunings. The 
    problem isn't just that I can't remember the tuning (I can't) but also I 
    had adjusted the tuning on one of the strings, so it's not, like, a real 
    tuning. I ended up breaking the string by doing this a couple times. Kind 
    of stupid. I'm 
    better now I promise! (haha get it, becuse the song is called "promise me") 
    Anyways I'm just going to put it here...

<p>I wrote it while I was in the process of moving all my recording equipment, 
     thinking I'd eventually get around to re-recording it. Well, now that 
     I'm starting to toy with the idea of playing it live, I'm realizing
     I may not be able to get it to sound the same.
