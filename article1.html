        <h2>MUSIC VIDEOS</h2>
        <h3>05/18/24</h3>
        <p>Music and film are my favorite artistic
            storytelling forms, so naturally I have pretty
            strong feelings about music videos. A good music 
            video can lend more context to a song, or allow
            musicians the freedom to express themselves in 
            new ways. And they're just fun. Here are some of my favorites.

        <p>The two music videos off of Pedro the Lion's album Pheonix
            both make my favorites list on their own, but they are even better
            as a pair. They're both shot on 16mm film, and I appreciate the
            haunting, introspective beauty of both the songs and the video
            more each time I watch them. The film seems to have been intentionally
            exposed after shooting, creating vivid colors that flicker and 
            wash over the video. Overall, they serve as impressively crafted visual
            accompaniments to both the songs and the album as a whole.

        <h2>PEDRO THE LION</h2>
        <h3>05/18/24</h3>
        <p>
            Okay so thoughts on the upcoming Pedro album --- 
            Santa Cruz is picking up where Havasu left off, covering
            his later teenage years up until the release of his first album
            in his early 20s. 
            <br> I can't help but feel especially connected 
            to the subject matter, being that I've just started to take 
            songwriting more seriously, and I'll turn 21 two months from today.
            Much of what David Bazan wrote when he was my age really speaks
            to me. Maybe I'm the target audience, or maybe he was also just a 20
            year old, writing about feelings a lot of 20 year olds share, but
            as I'm sure any fan of his work would agree, there's something
            really special about those early albums. 
            <br><br>
            As far as the singles from Santa Cruz that have been released so far, 
            I'm really loving them! Spend Time is almost danceable, and
            I'm excited to hear it when I see them live next month. 
            I love the songwriting on Modesto, and the arps after the key change are
            just super. Honestly the mixing on all the singles are awesome. Real
            punchy vocals and lots of layering with the guitars. 
            <br><br>David Bazan has an impressive ability to distill memories into
            his music, preserving all the emotion and personal detail within
            them, while introducing a new layer of maturity from years of reflection.
            As someone who struggles to describe my past, PTL's music soothes
            part of me that worries I'll never find the right words. And the fact that
            the new record aims to reflect on an age I am currently experiencing
            reminds me that the present is just as important as the past I've been
            trying to explain. Anyways, all that is to say I'm excited to hear
            what David Bazan has to share.
