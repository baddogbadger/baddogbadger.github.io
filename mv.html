        <h2>MUSIC VIDEOS</h2>
        <h3>05/18/24</h3>
        <p>Music and film are my favorite artistic
            storytelling forms, so naturally I have pretty
            strong feelings about music videos. A good music 
            video can lend more context to a song, or allow
            musicians the freedom to express themselves in 
            new ways. And they're just fun. Here are some of my favorites.

        <p>The two music videos off of Pedro the Lion's album Pheonix
            both make my favorites list on their own, but they are even better
            as a pair. They're both shot on 16mm film, and I appreciate the
            haunting, introspective beauty of both the songs and the video
            more each time I watch them. The film seems to have been intentionally
            exposed after shooting, creating vivid colors that flicker and 
            wash over the video. Overall, they serve as impressively crafted visual
            accompaniments to both the songs and the album as a whole.
