My teenage years marked the end of what I consider the 
                            "golden age" of socials media. These websites and apps I once 
                            visited to see what my friends were sharing, or to find 
                            new people to follow and talk to and be inspired by, were 
                            changed dramatically in the algorithm age. it seems like more 
                            and more, social media is becoming harder to divorce from the 
                            internet as a whole. Images and articles hosted by social media sites 
                            dominate search algorithms. <br>
